## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Engincan Veske â€” a software engineer, open-source contributor, writer, and speaker. I love building high-quality, scalable applications, sharing knowledge, and exploring new technologies.

I currently work at **Volosoft**, where I develop enterprise-level solutions using **.NET, cloud services, and modern architectural patterns**. Iâ€™m also an active contributor to the **ABP Framework**, helping developers build modular and maintainable applications.

## What I Do

* **Software Engineering** â€“ I specialize in **.NET, cloud computing, microservices, and scalable architectures**. My passion lies in building efficient, well-structured applications.

* **Open Source & ABP Framework** â€“ As an ABP Framework team member, I contribute to its development, write documentation, and help the community leverage its full potential.

* **Technical Writing** â€“ I share insights on **.NET, ABP, software architecture, and best practices** on [various platforms](https://engincanveske.substack.com/p/links).

* **Public Speaking** â€“ I enjoy speaking at tech events. [See all my talks & their presentations](https://github.com/EngincanV/presentations)

* **Podcasts** â€“ I co-host two Turkish podcasts with fellow developers:

  * dotcode â€“ Discussions on **software engineering and tech news**.

  * SÄ±fÄ±rdan Bire â€“ Conversations about **career growth, development practices, and real-world experiences**.

## Why I Do It

Technology is constantly evolving, and I believe in **continuous learning and knowledge sharing**. Whether through writing, speaking, or open-source contributions, I aim to make complex topics easier to understand and help developers grow.
